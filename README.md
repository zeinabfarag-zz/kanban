## Overview

A mern stack application designed to help users visualize all their tasks in one place.

## Description

An application to track and visualize all your tasks! This application allows for users create multiple boards in which each boards has a customized number of columns. Within the columns you can add your tasks into cards which you can then drag between the columns. These cards are where you can add the tasks description, deadline, tag, and/or attachment. If your task happens to have a deadline, it will appear when toggling over to the calendar view. You then have the option to move around the card within the calendar to change the deadline or click on it to view/edit.
