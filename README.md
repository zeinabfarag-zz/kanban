## Overview

A mern stack application designed to help users visualize all their tasks in one place.

## Description

A web app that helps users visualize their homework, exams and projects all in one place. You
can create boards with multiple columns. You can add tasks under each column (they look like cards) and drag tasks across
the boards. In each of the tasks cards you can set deadlines, add description, tag, and/or attachment. All tasks with deadlines will then be added to the calendar view where you are able to drag the tasks around to change the deadline if needed or click on the card to make any updates.
